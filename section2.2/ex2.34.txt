Evaluating a polynomial in x at a given value of x can be formulated as an
accumulation. We evaluate the polynomial

anx^n + an-1x^n-1 + . . . + a1x + a0

using a well-known algorithm called Horner’s rule, which structures the
computation as

(. . .(anx + an-1)x + . . . + a1)x + a0

In other words, we start with an, multiply by x, add an-1, multiply by x, and
so on, until we reach a0.

Fill in the following template to produce a procedure that evaluates a
polynomial using Horner’s rule. Assume that the coefﬁcients of the polynomial
are arranged in a sequence, from a0 through an.

; you have to reverse the list, otherwise it doesn't work, accumulate is not
; exactly equal to reduce
(defn horner-eval [x coefficient-sequence]
  (reduce #(+ (* %1 x) %2) 0 (reverse coefficient-sequence)))

For example, to compute 1 + 3x + 5x^3 + x^5 at x = 2 you would evaluate

(horner-eval 2 (list 1 3 0 5 0 1))
